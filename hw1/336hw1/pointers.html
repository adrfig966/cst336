                Pointers do exactly what they sound like. They point. But not the kind of pointing you and I are used to. Instead, they <strong>point to addresses</strong>
                of computer memory. When you initialize an integer type in any programming language an integer value is stored at an address in memory.
                When you initialize a pointer, instead of a value, we store an address. Yes, we are storing an address at an address in memory, so it also takes up
                space. As illustrated on the image to the right. Looking closer we see that variable <i>a</i> represents address <i>0002</i> while its value is <i>1008</i>.
                The arrow signifies that this is not an integer value but instead a memory address. Through our pointer we can also access the value at the address being 
                pointed to.
