                Classes are an essential part of <strong>object-oriented programming</strong>. They make up the <strong>object</strong> part.
                A class attempts to model something which has numerical and alphamuerical attributes. These attributes can then be operated on within the class.
                These are <strong>methods</strong> of the class. Methods or <strong>member functions</strong> exist within the class to help it interact with data outside
                of its scope. In our example image we are attempting to represent a car. Some of the attributes of a vehicle include max speed and fuel
                so we add those as numerical values that belong to the class as  <i>maxspeed</i> and <i>fuel</i>. An instance of a class is called an object, we can
                think of a class as an outline. When we instantiate a class in our code it is then an <strong>object</strong>, it can be given values. Perhaps we have two car objects. One may have a different top speed.
                We can then use our class methods <i>getSpeed()</i> to return the <i>maxspeed</i> value of the car object to wherever the method was called.
                This same idea is used to give values. We pass them as parameters. Then within the method we assign the values.
