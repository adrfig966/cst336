            <p>This website is not about stacked sandwiches. </p>
            <p>It isn't about stacks of cash either.</p>
            <p>But it is about the <strong>data structure</strong> known as a <strong>stack</strong>.
            A stack is a way of storing data that can best be visualized as stacking a sandwich.
            When most people stack a sandwich they first start with the bread. Then they add ham, then cheese on top of that, etc.
            A stack works the same way, we start with one node of data, then add another node that's attached to the initial node, we add another node
            attached to that one, etc. The thing that sets it apart from the sandwich is: if you wanna access that first data node you can't 
            just flip over the stack of data like you could the sandwich. To access the initial piece of data you have to remove the last node you attached,
            followed by the one after that, etc. You remove the nodes until you reach the first node. This is known as a last-in-first-out policy. Meaning the last node
            to get put in to the structure is the first to come out. 
            </p>

            <br> Before you can make one of these there are some prequisites: first we must learn about classes and pointers.
